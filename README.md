# classical-mechanics
This repository contains numerical solutions to selected problems for Classical Mechanics (5th edition) by Dr. John Taylor and Introduction to Classical Mechanics by Dr. David Morin.

The purpose of this project is mainly for me to practice scientific computing in the python language as well as brush up on some physics.  Additionally, others may benefit from seeing some numerical solutions.  

Disclaimer: I am not a software developer by trade, my background is in mathematics and mechanical engineering.  I have made efforts to keep code clean and documented.  For Morin, I follow his style of numerical solution, but occasionally will add something.  If the problem is very interesting, I will solve it and display some of the interesting plots from the solutions.

Enjoy!
